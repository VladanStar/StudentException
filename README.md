# StudentException
Make a hierarchy of exceptions related to student entry. Each student has a name, surname, address, city, index. If it happens that the index has more or less than 4 characters, the IndexNot ValidException should happen. If the student's name does not have at least 2 characters, the NameNot ValidException should occur. All Exception related to the shipment should inherit the StudentException. Test the operation of exceptions through the startup class.
